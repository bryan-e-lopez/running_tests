IF you havent compiled and ran a c++ program since the 1980s here are a few tips:

* use the command line utility `g++` and pass the file name as an argument
* `g++ main.cpp` || you can also redirect the output like this `g++ -o main main.cpp`
* this will generate a a.out file that you can run and view the test results
