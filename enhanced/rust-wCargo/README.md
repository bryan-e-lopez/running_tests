This is a small rust program that tests the same functionality as the others. 

Please compile the rust program first and then execute the tests. 

The commands are: 
    `cargo run` 
    `./target/debug/rust-wCargo`
    `cargo test` 


- cargo run, takes care of compiling the rust code\
- the second command is the path to the executable that is stored in ./target/debug/<name>
- cargo tests is in charge of running the unit tests in the program 

I put together the `start.sh` script to run. If you are unable to run it, you will have to follow the commands above
