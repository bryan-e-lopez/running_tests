# running_tests

This repository has multiple different unit tests coded as one-off code snippets. The tests are currently broken on ALL due to `minor typos`. What you will need to do is download the code, fix it, compile and run it. Once you get things to work and the tests to PASS, please take a screenshot and attach it to your submission sheet.
